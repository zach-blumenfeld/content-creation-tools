# Content Creation Tools
Work: make AI do it for you!

A random collection of AI tools to automate marketing work that I am either to lazy or nerdy to do manually.

1. `transcribe-video`: Create a video transcript from an mp4 file using OpenAI Whisper
2. `writing-task-given-mpf`:  Generate written content grounded with your Messaging and Positioning Framework (MPF)

## Note of Caution: 
Use your head. AI gives you materials to work with and tune, it doesn't do everything perfect or replace you. Review what is produced and use it appropriately. You still have to actually work, you just get to automate out some of the most tedious work so your life can suck a little less.  Have fun.
